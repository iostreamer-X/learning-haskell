# Install
I recommend using `cabal build` then `cabal run` but you could always compile directly through ghc.

# Lessons learnt 
- Recrsion can be used to achieve strong and meaningful one liners.
- The module system is very straight forward and simple, much like modern languages.
- Parially applied functions come handy.
